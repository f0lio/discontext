  "The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries.",
  "Opposites Canâ€™t Both Be Right",
  "Wrongly chosen synonyms can dramatically change the meaning of a sentence, and thereby the semantic similarity score.",
  "History can be the only true judge of the past and the present. But future is, definitely, the best judge of the present.",

  "The world is round",
  "Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with physical phenomena at nanoscopic scales, where the action is on the order of the Planck constant. It departs from classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter. Quantum mechanics provides a substantially useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements including the behavior of atoms during chemical bonding and has played a significant role in the development of many modern technologies.",

The oceans are the largest of the Earth's water bodies and are all connected to one another. The oceans are the most important of the world's great biomes. Because of their size, they influence the climate of the Earth and play a major role in the biosphere and the water cycle.",
